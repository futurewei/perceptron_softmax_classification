# classification Project


In this project, I first implemented a perceptron classifier to classify pacman images. Besides perceptron classifier, I also used softmax classifier in identifying MNISt dataset. The feature I used in identifying MNIST dataset is the number of continous white regions in the image, which helps achieve an 88% accuracy using softmax classifier. 

While the accuracy is indeed pretty bad compared to Convolutional network, it's considered a practice in traditional machine learning training.
